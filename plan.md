# Plan for Haya Shield

## Domain Tracker

- Domain Sniffer: Gets all the domains the current device is interacting with
- Blocklist matching: Maintains a blocklist and matches domains in that
- Trigger actions: Log accessed domains or trigger some action
- Run silently as a system tool and restarts if service is terminated
